# E-commerce-application

I used React JS in the implementation of the code, used Bootstrap and CSS to add some styling of the pages and content of the pages.

The application consists from some pages in the front-end part, and in the back-end I make the database as JSON files: one for the products and one for the admins.

Then calling the back-end and the databases using axios library in React.
Here I used Rest API as I can get data from the API by using an async function.

For a user: he can browse through the menu and add to the cart what items he wants then choose the quantity of each item in the cart and he can delete items from the cart, then choose the payment method he wants weather by Visa or by cash after the items shipped to him.

For an admin: after he enters the right password and username, he can edit the products by changing anything in the product he chooses to edit or he can add new products to the menu or delete products in the menu.
Admin can add image with the products in add or edit by browsing from the local PC which he use to make his modifications on the products.
